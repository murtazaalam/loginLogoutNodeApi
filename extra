bcrypt.hashSync(req.body.password, saltRounds);
1. With "salt round" they actually mean the cost factor. The cost factor controls how much time is needed to calculate a single 
BCrypt hash. The higher the cost factor, the more hashing rounds are done. Increasing the cost factor by 1 doubles the necessary time. 
The more time is necessary, the more difficult is brute-forcing.
2. The salt is a random value, and should differ for each calculation, so the result should hardly ever be the same, even for equal 
passwords.
